    Compute the silhouette coefficients for each sample in :math:`\mathbf{X}`.
    Each coefficient is calculated using the mean intra-cluster
    distance (:math:`a`) and the mean nearest-cluster distance (:math:`b`) of
    the sample, according to the formula :math:`(b - a) / max(a, b)`.
    The best value is 1 and the worst value is -1. Values near 0 indicate
    overlapping clusters. Negative values generally indicate that a sample has
    been assigned to the wrong cluster, as a different cluster is more similar.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : torch.Tensor or np.ndarray of shape (n_samples_x, n_features)
        Input data.
    labels : torch.Tensor or np.ndarray of shape (n_samples_x,)
        Labels associated to X.
    weights : torch.Tensor or np.ndarray of shape (n_samples_x,), optional
        Probability vector taking into account the relative importance
        of samples in X. The default is None and considers uniform weights.
    metric : str, optional
        The distance to use for computing pairwise distances. Must be an
        element of LIST_METRICS. The default is 'euclidean'.
    device : str, optional
        Device to use for computations.
    keops : bool, optional
        Whether to use KeOps for computations.

    Returns
    -------
    coefficients : torch.Tensor or np.ndarray of shape (n_samples_x,)
        Silhouette coefficients for each sample.
